## Introduction 🌟
This report summarizes the work I completed on the Sugarizer 3D Volume and Human Body Activities project for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024.

## 3D Volume Activity 🎲
The 3D Volume Activity includes various features like adding and removing different volumes, changing the board background, and even shaking the board.

### Features Implemented

- Add volumes of various shapes such as cubes, tetrahedrons, octahedrons, decahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons.
- Remove volumes by clicking on them.
- Change the volume type to one of three options: default, semi-transparent, or numbered.
- Calculate scores based on the numbers on top of numbered volumes.
- Customize volume and text color.
- Change the board background, each with different friction levels.
- Zoom in and out, and rotate the board in all four directions.
- Shake the board to make the dice collide.
- On mobile devices and tablets, users can enable a mode that changes the direction of gravity based on the device's tilt.
- Enjoy multiplayer mode, allowing all connected users to interact with all features.

## Human Body Activity 🧑
The Human Body Activity offers features like coloring body parts, a tour mode of body parts, and more.

### Features Implemented

- Color different parts of the body.
- Take a tour of various body parts.
- Learn about body parts by clicking on them.
- In Doctor Mode, users are asked to identify a body part and will be informed if they are correct.
- Use the activity in shared mode, where all users can color body parts.
- Play the Doctor Game in shared mode, where all users are prompted to find a specific body part, and the first to find it earns a point.

## Challenges Faced During Project 
- Managing my time.
- Since the physics library I have used has a few bugs in it, thus I had to find work arounds for the bugs.
- Finding free to use 3D assets for the Human Body Activity.

## Personal Journey & Growth 🌈
Participating in Google Summer of Code 2023 with Sugar Labs 🌟 has been a truly remarkable experience! 🚀 I've gained invaluable insights into open-source development and the power of community collaboration 👥🌐. Tackling coding challenges felt like piecing together intricate puzzles 🧩, and I’ve learned so much through this process. I’m thrilled to continue contributing and nurturing the spirit of open-source! 💙

## Acknowledgments 🙏
A big thank you to the amazing Sugar Labs community and the Sugarizer project! Immense gratitude 🙌 to my mentor, Lionel Laské 🌟, for his unwavering support and guidance. I also appreciate Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 🎓 for offering this fantastic opportunity. Looking forward to more contributions and continued learning 🚀.
